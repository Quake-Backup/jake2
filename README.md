|CircleCi build:   | [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/demoth/jake2/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/demoth/jake2/tree/master)   |

Jake2 is a port of the GPL'd Quake2 engine from id Software to Java. Jake2 is
distributed under the terms of the GPL (see LICENSE).

The port was done completely in Java. No native libraries are used for the
game functionality. We use the lwjgl2 for graphics rendering and for sound.

Jake2 is still under development. Feel free to send bug report if you find one.

Currently Jake2 supports Linux, Windows2000/XP and Mac OS X. The Jake2 dedicated
server runs on every Java supported platform.

Requirements:

 * at least JDK 1.8 to build and run Jake2

Please not that there is an issue with more recent java versions on linux with lwjgl natives.

Installation
------------

from binary distribution:

- unzip the distribution(jake2-some_version.zip)
- go to bin folder
- run jake2 (or jake2.bat on windows)

build from source:

- run `gradle run` to build from source and run jake2
- run `gradle distZip` to build the distribution

If you don't have a gradle distribution you can use gradle wrapper, like `./gradlew run`.

Installation of Quake2 data:
----------------------------

If Jake2 does not detect the Quake2 files on startup you have the choice
to select a baseq2 directory of a Quake2 installation (demo or full version)
or to download and install the Quake2 demo files

If you want to have the latest experimental features you can grab the latest
Jake2 sources from GIT.

3rd party components
--------------------

Jake2 uses:
lwjgl    Light Weight Java Game Library http://www.lwjgl.org
openal   Audio library                  http://www.openal.org
